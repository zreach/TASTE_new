# TASTE



TASTE is a framework for content-augumented Music Recommendation. It is developed for reproducing and developing recommendation algorithms with content more efficiently.

The proposed subset of lfm-1b and corresponding embedded wav features can be downloaded here: [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1H-wrqchl-QMWrO-13mueeO5t-7nL00JU?usp=sharing)

    <p>Figure : Overview of the TASTE framework for content-augmented music recommendation.</p>
</div>

This framework includes feature extraction, feature fusion, model training, and testing. 

The traditional features are embedded in the way commonly followed: discrete features are processed using one-hot encoding, then mapped to lower-dimensional continuous vectors; continuous features are discretized according to the defined method by default, and then treated as discrete features (other methods can also be used to handle continuous features).

After the audio and text features are extracted, they pass through trainable MLP layers and are then merged with the previously extracted features to be input into various models, which ultimately output the predicted click-through rate.

Furthermore, we applied the **MuQ-token** method to the multi-layer output of our ""MuQ"" model. By using discrete tokens to represent the audio features, we were able to achieve better results

Our method is highly compatible with various models because it only adds more features without requiring any changes to the model's structure itself.

## Usage

Clone this repository to the local machine, then install the dependencies.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you want to manually extract audio features based on your own data and model, you can use the `./notebook/extract_feature.ipynb` in the `./notebooks/` directory. For detailed instructions, please refer to the script files.

### Quick-Start

After downloading the data, place it in `datas\lfm1b-filtered` and then run the following command:

```
python main.py
```

This command runs the framework with the default settings in the simplest way. If adjustments are needed afterward, parameters can be set either through the command line or by using YAML files，for example:

```
python main.py --model_name LR --dataset_name lfm1n-filtered ----config_files config/config1.yaml
```


## Models

Currently, we have implemented the following models on TASTE:

## Audio Featrues

We use pre-trained models to extract high-level music information. The following are the models we used:

| Model     | Publish     | Paper | 
| :-------- | :---------- |   :----------------------------------------------------------- | 
| [CLAP](https://github.com/microsoft/clap)      | ICASSP'22    | Natural Language Supervision For General-Purpose Audio Representations |
| [MuQ](https://github.com/tencent-ailab/MuQ)       | arxiv    | MuQ: Self-Supervised Music Representation Learning with Mel Residual Vector Quantization  |

The MuQ model has two versions: **MuQ** and **MuQ-mulan**.

* **MuQ** provides the model's raw output, which includes both the number of layers and the time dimension. 
* **MuQ-mulan** is a fine-tuned version of MuQ, trained specifically on a music-text dataset, and its output has a shape of (512,).
